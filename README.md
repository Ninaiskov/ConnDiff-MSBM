# ConnDiff-MultSBM
Code for Network Neuroscience article: "Discovering Prominent Differences in Structural and Functional Connectomes Using the Multinomial Stochastic Block Model"

This work showcase how MSBM can offer valuable insights to brain connectivity as well as many other potential applications where differences across graph-data are of interest.

### Data
Data used from Human Connectome Project (HCP) and synthetic data is located in data folder.

### Results
Result files 'model_sample.npy' including MAP partition matrix Z are located in results folder under respective experiment subfolder (only results files for best runs for HCP data are uploaded)

#### Examples of results for 25 clusters
